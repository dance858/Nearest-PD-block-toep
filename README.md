# Nearest-PD-block-toep
This repository contains an implementation of a Bregman proximal gradient method for projecting a matrix onto the cone of positive semidefinite block Toeplitz matrices.
For more details, see the project report XXX. 

This was my project in MS&E 310 Conic Linear Optimization (taught by Professor Yinyu Ye).
